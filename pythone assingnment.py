# 1 what is OOP?
#  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software.
#  It allows for the encapsulation of data and behavior, making it easier to manage and scale applications.
class animal
def(self ):
return "some sound"

# 2 what is a class? 
#  A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
#  It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

# 3  What is a Constructor?

#A constructor is a special method called when an object is instantiated.
It typically initializes the attributes of the object.


#4  What is Inheritance?
#Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).
 #This promotes code reusability.
